\section*{Introduction}
Sorting is a rudimentary but essential element of handling data. Applications of sorting range from simple applications to major optimizations in large systems.
Sorting a finite collection of linear data can be done in various ways, each way having it's own advantages and disadvantages.
This project aims to create a basic system for automatic comparison of algorithms with random data.
\subsection*{Design}
Everything in this project, including this very report was generated automatically from pre-written code using the following build system.\\
\subsubsection*{Makefile}
\inputminted{make}{Makefile}
This build system automatically checks for changes in all files and rebuilds the elements necessary.
All algorithms need to be implemented in C and kept in the \emph{code/sorts} directory.
Comparison, plotting and inclusion of the algorithm in this report is done automatically by the build system.
Tests are written in a file which is to output the data as csv.
\subsubsection*{code/test.c}
\inputminted{c}{code/test.c}
Data is plotted into using the following code.
\subsubsection*{code/graph.py}
\inputminted{python}{code/graph.py}
\section*{Code}
What follows is all the implementations currently provided in this project.
It is to be noted that addition or removal of any algorithm is automatically going to change this report accordingly.
\input{latex/implementations.tex}
\section*{Comparision}
All of the given algorithms are automatically compared into the following graph.\\
